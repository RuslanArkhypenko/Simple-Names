# TASK
Build a small app with the following features:

- Extremely simple management of contacts
- Loads list of contacts from a server (should the server not be reachable, local contacts should still be shown from CoreData)
- Saves contacts in CoreData
- Adds contacts via input fields
- Deletes contacts in CoreData with swipe-to-delete gesture
- Updates information in CoreData with pull-to-refresh gesture (data is always pulled from the server and locally created contacts should remain unchanged)
